<h2>What is Alpha Epsilon Pi?</h2>
<p>Alpha Epsilon Pi is a Jewish fraternity based mostly in the United States and Canada, with Chapters in Australia, Israel, France, the UK and Austria. AEPi was founded on the ideals of brotherhood and giving back to the community at New York University in 1913 by Charles C. Moskowitz and ten of his Jewish friends. It is now the 7th largest fraternity in the world with more than 186 active Chapters, and the only fraternity to ever successfully become international.</p>

<h2>What does AEPi do?</h2>
<p>AEPi is more than just a fraternity, and does more than just social events. From charity fundraisers, to nature retreats, to workshops with field-leading experts, AEPi brings together students across the world in a fun, supportive environment.</p>

<blockquote><i>"AEPi has given me friends for life and I couldn’t be more grateful for that."</i> - <b>Josh, 3rd Year Law Student</b></blockquote>

<h2>What about in Sydney?</h2>
<p>The Sydney Chapter of AEPi is one of the most successful yet. With over 25 members and a House on campus after only a year of existence, we’re smashing goals all over! We held a ‘Bros Who Bake’ sale together with AUJS, raising over $500 for leukemia research. We were also excited to offer authentic Jewish experiences to over 100 participants in 2016. Don’t trust us? According to Andy Borans, Executive Director of AEPi:</p>

<blockquote><i>"The founding fathers in Sydney, Australia took an uncertain plunge... and have shined brighter than we could have ever imagined. These men are providing a welcoming atmosphere for students with an idea they only came to know less than a year ago."</i> - <b>Andy Borans, Executive Director of AEPi</b></blockquote>
