body: "We were very proud to welcome in our brand new Zeta class to the chapter, hot off their initiation last Sunday. After a long, ten weeks of our pledge program, we're thrilled to now be able to call Josh Amoils, Jay Kaplan, Lev Roz, and Daniel Zakoshanski our brothers.
<br /><br />
Thank you to all the brothers that joined us to make it a very special celebration of brotherhood. From Founding Fathers to Epsilon Class, it was one for the books!"
