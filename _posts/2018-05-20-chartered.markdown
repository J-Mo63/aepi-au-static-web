body: "AEPi Sydney is proud to announce both our Chartering by Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity and the initiation of our new Delta Class in the same weekend! We were lucky to have Andy Borans, AEPiâ€™s Executive Director, as well as other alumni and dignitaries present for the ceremony.
<br /><br />
Thank you to all the community support that made our Chartering a reality, including Shalom, B'nai B'rith NSW, AUJS NSW, NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, Rabbi Eli Feldman and JUNI, Mandelbaum House, Emanuel Synagogue, The Australian Jewish News and Amaze in Taste."
