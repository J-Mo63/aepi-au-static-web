body: "During the first two weeks of August, six of our Brothers from Sydney travelled to Phoenix to attend AEPi's 105th International Convention. AEPi Sydney were recognised for our contribution to the Sydney Jewish community with The Philip & Susan Cohen Jewish Communal Activity Award!
<br /><br />
We're also excited to announce that our Brother Ben Ezzes was awarded the highly prestigious Nehemiah Gitelson Medallion. Ben was selected as one of only three Brothers across AEPi internationally for his contributions to the Sydney Jewish community!"
