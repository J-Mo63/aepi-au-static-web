body: "In light of R U OK Day, we’d like to send a message of support to all of those around us. That there is always a place to talk and express yourselves.
<br /><br />
As a brotherhood, we pride ourselves on being an open and considerate space for young men, who are one of the most vulnerable to suicidal thoughts and actions, to access a supportive community in which they have a support system during difficult times.
<br /><br />
“But my soul I could not see.
<br />
I sought my God, But my God eluded me.
<br />
I sought my brother, And I found all three.”"
