body: "With Rush now over and March coming to a close, AEPi Sydney can take a moment to reflect on an incredible month with 300+ visitors coming to our new House. We held a number of successful events including poker, boardgames and even a few Shabbat dinners, and have proudly capped off our start of semester with the induction of over a dozen new members!"
