body: "At the end of a whirlwind semester, AEPi Sydney once again embarked upon their annual winter beach retreat at Manyana, down on the South Coast. It was a weekend filled with good eats, good mates, good vibes, good hangs, and good relaxing time - how good!
<br /><br />
And as always, for those of you who couldn't be there this time, we hope you can join us on the next episode!"
