body: "In 1913, a Jewish economics student Charles C. Moskowitz established Alpha Epsilon Pi (AEPi) in the cellar of a sausage shop in New York city, founding the only Jewish fraternity in the US. That fraternity grew from 10 members in 1913 to more than 102,000 worldwide in 2016, and has now expanded to include Sydney."
