body: "With our autumn rush now over, we would like to say a huge thank you to all of you who joined us in these last two epic weeks of events!
<br /><br />
And for those of you that didn't get to shark us at poker, chow down on wings with us, or join for a hummus-filled shabbat dinner, we'll be back at the start of next sem with even more great events!"
