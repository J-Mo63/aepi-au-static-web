body: "Last month, six brothers of the Sydney chapter travelled to the annual AEPi International Convention in Washington DC, making it the largest ever Australian delegation.
<br /><br />
At convention, brothers took part in leadership development, Jewish identity, and tikkun olam programs to help develop their skills, knowledge, and understanding of what it means to be a brother of Alpha Epsilon Pi. It was also incredible opportunity for brothers to make connections with undergraduates from all over the world including the US, Canada, the UK, Austria, and Israel.
<br /><br />
As always, we look forward to doing it all again next year - this time in Atlanta!"
