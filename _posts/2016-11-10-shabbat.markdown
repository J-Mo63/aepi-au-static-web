body: "Despite the looming threat of exams, our brothers were excited to welcome Adam Albert, the final member of our Alpha class, into AEPi. We also came together for our inaugural Shabbat Across AEPi, where pool took priority over school. It was an amazing experience to share with over 400 chapters, having their own dinners across the world on the same night."
