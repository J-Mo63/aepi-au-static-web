body: "After two successful on-campus sukkah stands (shout out to JUNI, AUJS UNSW and AUJS at the University of Sydney) and a charity poker night, we've smashed our $500 semester goal for donation to the Gift of Life Foundation. Thank you to everyone who came by, and keep an eye out for more AEPi events to come."
